# Diabetes Predictive Analysis

## Introduction
This project aims to create a predictive model to help analyze the potential for diabetes in patients in Indonesia. Using data from Kaggle and generated by ChatGPT, the project explores three main machine learning algorithms: XGBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier to analyze a dataset containing 1,879 entries with 50 attributes.

## Technologies Used
This project leverages various technologies, including Python with libraries such as Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis and modeling were conducted on Google Colab, incorporating key processes such as data cleaning, normalization, encoding, data visualization, and the application of machine learning models.

## Methodology
The analysis began with understanding and integrating data from multiple sources. Irrelevant attributes, outliers, and duplicates were removed to ensure data quality. One-Hot Encoding and normalization were applied to the data. The dataset was then split into 80% training data and 20% testing data to prepare for modeling. The project explored three machine learning models: XGBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier. Each model was built and evaluated using various metrics to determine their performance.

## Result
The modeling phase focused on building and evaluating three machine learning models: XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. Each model was assessed using metrics such as ROC AUC, KS Score, precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. Among these, the XGBoost Classifier emerged as the best-performing model with an ROC AUC score of 0.9551 and an accuracy of 93%. It demonstrated a strong balance between precision and recall, though further improvements in recall for the positive class are needed.

The Random Forest Classifier achieved an ROC AUC score of 0.9444 and an accuracy of 91%, excelling in precision but falling slightly short in recall compared to XGBoost. The Decision Tree Classifier, while being the simplest model to understand, showed an accuracy of 89%. However, it lagged behind in precision and recall relative to the other models.

In conclusion, this project highlights the potential of advanced machine learning models like XGBoost to provide reliable predictions and valuable insights into diabetes risk, aiding healthcare stakeholders in addressing this critical public health issue.
